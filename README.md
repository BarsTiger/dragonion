# dragonion
Most modern-looking, encrypted and functional in-console onion chat that you control! 

## üìù Note
Dragonion IS NOT a chat for everyday use. It is specific application focused on
privacy and safety. It can contain functions, that you won't like or don't contain 
some functions you would like to have in regular chat application. 
You need to set up [[dragonion-server]](https://github.com/BarsTiger/dragonion-server)
by yourself or using existing server, hosted by your guild/organisation. 
We don't provide any official servers.

DRAGONION IS NOW IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND THERE AREN'T ANY RELEASES HERE
